# Course-Data-Management-System-Using-Linked-Lists
Description:
This project involves the development of a Course Data Management System that utilizes linked list data structures to efficiently store and manipulate course information. The application provides a comprehensive set of features, allowing users to:

Add and Remove Courses: Users can insert new course data at both the beginning and end of the list, as well as delete existing course records.
Search and Display Data: The system enables users to search for courses by their codes, display the total number of courses, and list all entered course data.
Grade Analysis: Users can find the maximum and minimum grades, view a list of courses that have been failed based on a specified threshold, and calculate average grades.
Data Persistence: The program offers functionality to save course data to a text file, ensuring data retention even after the application is closed.
Data Integrity: A built-in security feature prevents the entry of duplicate course codes, maintaining the integrity of the data.
